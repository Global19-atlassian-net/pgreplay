Version 1.0.0

Bugfixes:
- Use "=" instead of "==" in "test" comparisons in configure.
  This improves portability.
- Change replay file timestamp to seconds after midnight of 2000-01-01
  in local time.  This makes the replay file format independent of time zones 
  and avoids problems with mktime(3) implementations that don't like
  the UNIX epoch.
- Ignore string literals in filter_bad_statements during log file parsing.
  This keeps the function from getting confused by the contents of the
  string.  Discovered by Josh Berkus.
