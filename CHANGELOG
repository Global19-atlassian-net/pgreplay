Version 1.0.0

Enhancements:
- Calculate parse and execution statistics and display them at the end
  of the run.

Bugfixes:
- Use "=" instead of "==" in "test" comparisons in configure.
  This improves portability.
- Change replay file timestamp to seconds after midnight of 2000-01-01
  in local time.  This makes the replay file format independent of time zones 
  and avoids problems with mktime(3) implementations that don't like
  the UNIX epoch.
- Ignore string literals in filter_bad_statements during log file parsing.
  This keeps the function from getting confused by the contents of the
  string.  Discovered by Josh Berkus.
- Correctly handle prepared statements without parameters.
  Discovered by Grigorij Lipin.
- Fix a corner case bug in read_log_line that can cause data corruption
  when parsing a stderr log.  Discovered by Grigorij Lipin.
